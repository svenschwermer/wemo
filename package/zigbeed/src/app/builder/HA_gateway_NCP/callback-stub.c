/** @brief Allow Network Write Attribute
 *
 * This function is called by the application framework before it writes an
 * attribute in response to a write attribute request from an external device.
 * The value passed into this callback is the value to which the attribute is
 * to be set by the framework.
        Example:	In mirroring simple metering
 * data on an Energy Services Interface (ESI) (formerly called Energy Service
 * Portal (ESP) in SE 1.0).), a mirrored simple meter needs to write read-only
 * attributes on its mirror. The-meter-mirror sample application, located in
 * app/framework/sample-apps, uses this callback to allow the mirrored device
 * to write simple metering attributes on the mirror regardless of the fact
 * that most simple metering attributes are defined as read-only by the ZigBee
 * specification.
        Note:	The ZCL specification does not (as of this
 * writing) specify any permission-level security for writing writeable
 * attributes. As far as the ZCL specification is concerned, if an attribute
 * is writeable, any device that has a link key for the device should be able
 * to write that attribute. Furthermore if an attribute is read only, it
 * should not be written over the air. Thus, if you implement permissions for
 * writing attributes as a feature, you MAY be operating outside the
 * specification. This is unlikely to be a problem for writing read-only
 * attributes, but it may be a problem for attributes that are writeable
 * according to the specification but restricted by the application
 * implementing this callback.

 * to write an external attribute, it makes a call to this callback.
       
 * This callback is very useful for host micros which need to store attributes
 * in persistent memory. Because each host micro (used with an Ember NCP) has
 * its own type of persistent memory storage, the Application Framework does
 * not include the ability to mark attributes as stored in flash the way that
 * it does for Ember SoCs like the EM35x. On a host micro, any attributes that
 * need to be stored in persistent memory should be marked as external and
 * accessed through the external read and write callbacks. Any host code
 * associated with the persistent storage should be implemented within this
 * callback.
        All of the important information about the attribute
 * itself is passed as a pointer to an EmberAfAttributeMetadata struct, which
 * is stored within the application and used to manage the attribute. A
 * complete description of the EmberAfAttributeMetadata struct is provided in
 * app/framework/include/af-types.h.
        This function assumes that the
 * application is able to write the attribute and return immediately. Any
 * attributes that require a state machine for reading and writing are not
 * candidates for externalization at the present time. The Application
 * Framework does not currently include a state machine for reading or writing
 * attributes that must take place across a series of application ticks.
 * Attributes that cannot be written immediately should be stored within the
 * Application Framework and updated occasionally by the application code from
 * within the emberAfMainTickCallback.
        If the application was
 * successfully able to write the attribute, it returns a value of
 * EMBER_ZCL_STATUS_SUCCESS. Any other return value indicates the application
 * was not able to write the attribute.
