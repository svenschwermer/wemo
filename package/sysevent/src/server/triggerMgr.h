                           Typedefs

The structures trigger_list_t, trigger_t, and trigger_action_t are
all related:
A triggerlist_t contains pointers to an arbitrary number of trigger_t
and a trigger_t contains pointers to an arbitrary number of trigger_action_t.

Each of the above structures are designed to hold arbitrary numbers of
other structures. This allows them to grow as required, and in theory
to shrink as well (although shrinking is not currently supported since
it does not appear that there will be a need for this).

                       FUNCTIONS

The TRIGGER_MGR is responsible for maintaining triggers and actions
to be applied when those triggers change state.

An action is a call that is executed when the trigger changes state.
An action is a function call along with the parameters to be passed
in that call. In general parameters are passed with exactly the same
value as was given when creating the action. However, if the parameter
begins with a $ then the value sent will be the current value of the
trigger for that value. If no such trigger exists yet, then "NULL" will
be sent as that parameter.
